# Formation-Aware Path Planning for Multi-Robot Transportation in Complex Environments

This repository contains the implementation for **"Formation-aware path planning for multi-robot transportation in complex environments"** submitted to RA-L.

## Overview

The goal of this work is to enable multi-robot transportation systems to navigate through static complex environments. The robots operate in a non-rigid formation that can dynamically change shape to traverse narrow passages and cross obstacles.

## Repository Structure

- **`map_analysis/`** - Terrain traversability analysis and global path computation
- **`obstacle_crossing/`** - Proposed algorithms for obstacle crossing with A* implementation for comparison

## Requirements

- **Python 3.9** or higher
- Dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`
